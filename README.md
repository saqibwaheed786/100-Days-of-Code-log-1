<!-- ## 05. Medium UI project
### Day 05: January 19, Friday

**Today's Progress :** Coded two more sections of the Medium UI project. Still have some problem in Firefox, I think most related to grid-row height. Will look into it, after coding it in Chrome. The story feed section seemed bit complex, but at the end it was just changing the flex-direction property and it worked. Cool!!

**Thoughts :** Over the course of time, my CSS course has improved a lot. Special thanks to the Udemy advanced CSS course. Feels quite confident working with CSS now. Now, need to get to that same level with Javascript too. Starting the JS course from tomorrow.

**Thing(s) learned :** More coding, less learning.

## 04. Working on MediumUI clone
### Day 04: January 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress :** Back to coding after 2 weeks. Made some progress on the medium UI project. Done with the header and top two sections.

![Medium Homepage clone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16104985/35112487-37cc1cb4-fca4-11e7-853c-5f135b3c7c84.png)

**Thoughts :** Its a good idea to practice both Dev and UI skills by cloning other sites. On that note, working on the medium homepage. Quite confident that I would be able to do it nearly the same. Although there's some margin issue on Firefox. Will debug them after doing it on Chrome.

**Thing(s) learned :** Nothing learnt. Mostly practicing upon the old ones.

## 03. Making CSS grid responsive
### Day 03: January 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress :** Had a bit of work left on the CSS grid project from yesterday. Wrote the media queries for the layout. Now, it looks on great on all widths.

**Thoughts :** Missed last day. Had extreme headache. Couldn't focus on work. Neeed to keep this missed day numbers minimal. Writing the media queries for grid and realized how easy it is now compared to the tons of code for floats and even flexbox. Most of the layout can be made responsive at the first place using properties like minmax(), min-content, max-content. Its all buttery smooth. The only problem is browser support. I dont want to write duplicate code for old browsers. So, from now on its going to be all grids. Flexbox at most as fallback. Couldn't start the medium-clone project as expected today. Lets get on with it with full force from tomorrow. ðŸ”¥

**Thing(s) learned :**
- How to make CSS grid layout responsive using media queries
- How to make fallback for grid using @supports rule

## 02. Completed Nexter project
### Day 02: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress :** Completed the nexter project as part of Advanced CSS course.

**Thoughts :** Learned lot about CSS Grid in this projects, in various situations and use cases. Will complete the media queries tomorrow. Then, moving on to the project- Cloning the homepage of Medium using grid. Quite excited. The completed project looks really great.

## 01. Working with CSS Grid
### Day 01: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress :** Made a reusable card component using grid and flexbox together. Worked on making a image gallery using CSS grid. Quite great, once got the hang of the syntax.

**Thoughts :** So far so good. CSS grid looks quite promising. It also made working with CSS layouts fun instead of the hack-n-slash with float. Important thing to note that Grid and flexbox compliment each other, not as replacement. Grid for 2D, Flexbox for 1D. The image gallery part was really cool. Basically it was just laying the template-columns and then placing each grid item following the grid-lines. Kid's stuff.

Also learned a rather cool emmet trick to use while writing HTML markup for this type of image gallery

```html
<!-- This and then pressing tab would-
(img.gallery__img--$[src="img/gallery-$"][alt="Gallery Image $"])*5

<!-- print this number of times specified in increasing order, ðŸ˜Ž
<img src="img/gallery-1" alt="Gallery Image 1" class="gallery__img--1">
```
**Thing(s) learned :**
- How to make a simple card component using grid and flexbox
- Grid overlapping method + z-index to position items.
- `<sup>` tag to write superscript numbers
- object-fit property for images to maintain aspect ratio

**Link(s) to work :**
- [CSS grid project code](https://github.com/shovanch/advanced-css-course-projects/tree/master/Nexter)
- [Live project site](https://shovanch.com/advanced-css-course-projects/Nexter/)  (work-in-progress)
