## 04 - 14. React and more React

**Day 04 - 14: June 1 - June 11**

**Today's Progress :** 
Logging the progress after longtime. I have been maintaining the coding habit daily. I made some simple react components and combined them to build more complex app. Enjoying the whole process so far. Worked on the movie project. Learning how to use API, maintain complex state. All pieces are fitting in like a puzzle. Moving with full steam ahead üî•

**Thoughts :**
I have great experience with React so far. There are not many things to learn, but figuring out which way to go to tackle a particular problem is more important. Getting comfortable with React methods now. Next step is to put all the things in practice. I got lots of awesome project ideas to implement, quite excited to build them. After that, will move on to Redux, testing and other advanced stuffs. 

**Thing(s) learned :**
- Handling API requests in React
- React component lifecycle and methods
- Handling state and props
- Input range slider
- React router and methods

## 03. React forms and Arrays

**Day 03: May 31, Thursday**

**Today's Progress :**
Learned how to handle events in React, use arrays inside JSX and render them.

**Thoughts :**
React is going all well. The previous learnings of JS is helping here. That's why fundamentals are always important, it makes learning things easier and faster down the road. Exams are coming too, tomorrow focus will be more on Data Structures and C++.

**Thing(s) learned :**
- How to handle events in React
- How to render array elements from JSX expression dynamically,

## 02. Setting up React and basics

**Day 02: May 30 , Wednesday**

**Today's Progress :**
Started Andrew Mead's React course, setup babel, live-server for JSX compilation. Pretty excited for the journey.

**Thoughts :**
Going to learn the fundamentals of React well enough before moving onto things Redux. Learn the fundamentals, apply them in projects, learn some more, apply them. So on and so forth. Going to summarise each weeks learning in the blog. That's a good way to learn.

**Thing(s) learned :**
- How to setup babel to compile React code
- JSX expressions, calling functions inside
- Conditional JSX rendering with logical opertors
- Quirks of ES6 arrow functions.
- Events and attributes

## 03. Objects, prototype and functions

### Day 03: Feb 3 , Saturday

**Today's Progress :** Made progress on the Advanced Objects and Functions section of the JS course. Learned about fundamental concepts like prototype, inheritance, first-class functions and lot more things.

**Thoughts :** Again fell short of goals that I set yesterday, Still progress is made. Need to carry the momentum forward. The JS course has been phenomenal so far. Lots of 'aha' moments here and there. Getting to know how things work from inside is truly enlighting. Going to focus on more on this path. Get really skilled with vanilla JS concepts. <br> Looked for some remote dev jobs offering. All's well with only one cavaet, 'The experience' requirement. Having said that, focus is to learn and build now, then moving to jobs.

**Thing(s) learned :**

* **Objects and Primitives**:
* **How inheritance works in JS**:
* **Prototype and Prototype chain**:
* **Creating objects using Function constructors**:
* **Creating objects using Object.create()**:
* **First class functions**:
* **Passing functions as an argument to another function**:
* **Functions returning functions**:
* **immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)**:

Whew... thats a hell lot of things. Will write detailed notes tomorrow after completing the whole section.

**Link(s) to work :**

* [Course Codes](https://codepen.io/shovanch/pen/xYZemV)

**Tomorrow's Goals**

* Complete the Advanced Objects and functions section and write detailed notes
* Solve the coding challenges and add the features in the DOM Pig game
* ~~Do 3 modules of JS30~~ [Only 1 done üòî]

---

## 02. Building JS Pig Game

### Day 02: Feb 2, Friday

**Today's Progress :** Completed DOM manipulation section of JS course. Build the JS Pig game. It's fun to play.

**Thoughts :** Building the JS pig game was quite fun. Learned about simple yet powerful concepts for working with the DOM. Most important thing, coding each part methodically like a piece of puzzle. Order in Chaos. Didn't work on JS30 today. Will compensate for it tomorrow. <br> Also, submitted the profile on Upwork but it got rejected due the reason of 'lack of oppurtunities'. Need to work on the core skills, make some awesome projects and resubmit again. Target -> 1st week of March.

**Thing(s) learned :**

* Accessing and manipulating the DOM elements
* **How events get processed** : With parallel to the execution stack there's a thing called 'message queue'. Where the events are stored in line. So, _when the execution is empty or all the functions have been returned_ then the next event in message queue gets processed, then it calls the event listener which itself is a function so it gets added to the execution stack and it goes on... üòÖ.
* **Callback functions** : Functions are which are not called by us. For example, inside event listener we dont put function call only the function name as the event listener will call the function when it gets processed in the execution stack.

```javascript
function f1() {
  // Do something
}

// Calling the function
f1();

// Function gets called by the event listener, hence no brackets. Its a callback function
dom.addEventListener("click", f1);
```

* Using _state variables_ to keep track of the status of the program

* [JS PIG game project](https://shovanch.com/JS-course-projects/DOM-Pig-Game/)
* [Project Code](https://github.com/shovanch/JS-course-projects/tree/master/DOM-Pig-Game)

**Tomorrow's Goals**

* Add the extra features to the game
* Complete Advanced Objects and Function section of the JS course
* Do modules 1 and 2 of JS30

## 01. Learning How JS works

### Day 01: Feb 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress :** Did 'How JS works' section of Complete JS developer course.

**Thoughts :** Learned How JS executes code in the background. Core concepts are really helpful to be a complete developer. It gives a new insight when solving the same problems. <br> Going to break the challenge into short term goals. Like for D30, the goal is to become proficient in JS and get started with React with more time spent on building actual projects.

**Thing(s) learned :**

* Written JS code goes into the JS engine (Ex: Chrome V8 Engine) where it first parsed into AST(Abstract Syntax tree) -> conversion to machine code -> then the machine code gets executed.
* **Execution context** is like a wrapper or container which store the variables and where code is evaluated and executed. Default execution context is global (Which is window object in browser).
* **Execution context** phases are divided into 1. Creation phase and 2. Execution Phase.
* In **Creation Phase**: First, the variable object is created. Code is scanned for function and variable declaration. Which gets moved to the top. Regardless of where they are declared. This behaviour called Hoisting. <br> For each function, a property gets created in the VO and its points to the actual function. As for the variable, it also gets a property is VO, but its value is set as undefined. thats why calling why a variable before its actual declared shows undefined, then it gets defined in execution phase. But, in ES6, this things matter less, as const and let are block scoped.
* **Scopes** : Creating the scope chain is 2nd step of creation phase. <br> Scopes answer where we can access a certain variable. Each function creates a scope. As for _lexical scoping_ it means function written within another function gets access to the scope of outer function. The default scope is global scope (Matters less in ES6).
* **Execution stack VS Scope chain**: Ex. context -> order in which functions are called. <br> Scope chain -> Order in which functions are written lexically.
* **this** : 3rd step of creation of phase of ECxt is determining and setting value of 'this' keyword. <br>
  _In regular function call_ -> 'this' points to the global object (window obj. in browser).
  _In object method call_ -> 'this' points to the object that is calling the method.
* 'this' is not assigned to a value untill a fn. where its actually defined is called. Using this concept, we can use method borrowing to share method between objects.

```javascript
obj1.method = obj2.method;
// calling the method from object 2
obj2.method();
```

* [Code examples](https://codepen.io/shovanch/pen/paJdKQ?editors=0012)

**Tomorrow's Goals**

* ~~Complete the DOM section of Complete JS course~~
* Complete module 1 & 2 of Javascript30

<!-- ## 05. Medium UI project
### Day 05: January 19, Friday

**Today's Progress :** Coded two more sections of the Medium UI project. Still have some problem in Firefox, I think most related to grid-row height. Will look into it, after coding it in Chrome. The story feed section seemed bit complex, but at the end it was just changing the flex-direction property and it worked. Cool!!

![Medium clone story feed section](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16104985/35186073-56f62e04-fe34-11e7-81d2-e99e61d998ed.png)

**Thoughts :** Over the course of time, my CSS course has improved a lot. Special thanks to the Udemy advanced CSS course. Feels quite confident working with CSS now. Now, need to get to that same level with Javascript too. Starting the JS course from tomorrow.

**Thing(s) learned :** More coding, less learning.

## 04. Working on MediumUI clone
### Day 04: January 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress :** Back to coding after 2 weeks. Made some progress on the medium UI project. Done with the header and top two sections.

![Medium Homepage clone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16104985/35112487-37cc1cb4-fca4-11e7-853c-5f135b3c7c84.png)

**Thoughts :** Its a good idea to practice both Dev and UI skills by cloning other sites. On that note, working on the medium homepage. Quite confident that I would be able to do it nearly the same. Although there's some margin issue on Firefox. Will debug them after doing it on Chrome.

**Thing(s) learned :** Nothing learnt. Mostly practicing upon the old ones.

## 03. Making CSS grid responsive
### Day 03: January 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress :** Had a bit of work left on the CSS grid project from yesterday. Wrote the media queries for the layout. Now, it looks on great on all widths.

**Thoughts :** Missed last day. Had extreme headache. Couldn't focus on work. Neeed to keep this missed day numbers minimal. Writing the media queries for grid and realized how easy it is now compared to the tons of code for floats and even flexbox. Most of the layout can be made responsive at the first place using properties like minmax(), min-content, max-content. Its all buttery smooth. The only problem is browser support. I dont want to write duplicate code for old browsers. So, from now on its going to be all grids. Flexbox at most as fallback. Couldn't start the medium-clone project as expected today. Lets get on with it with full force from tomorrow. üî•

**Thing(s) learned :**
- How to make CSS grid layout responsive using media queries
- How to make fallback for grid using @supports rule

**Link(s) to work :**

## 02. Completed Nexter project
### Day 02: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress :** Completed the nexter project as part of Advanced CSS course.

**Thoughts :** Learned lot about CSS Grid in this projects, in various situations and use cases. Will complete the media queries tomorrow. Then, moving on to the project- Cloning the homepage of Medium using grid. Quite excited. The completed project looks really great.

![Webpage gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/d2iYkL9TzZj7kGBO/giphy.gif)

**Thing(s) learned :**
- Using ::before and ::after pseudo elements as grid items
- How to make the commonly used 'Seen on' section

## 01. Working with CSS Grid
### Day 01: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress :** Made a reusable card component using grid and flexbox together. Worked on making a image gallery using CSS grid. Quite great, once got the hang of the syntax.

**Thoughts :** So far so good. CSS grid looks quite promising. It also made working with CSS layouts fun instead of the hack-n-slash with float. Important thing to note that Grid and flexbox compliment each other, not as replacement. Grid for 2D, Flexbox for 1D. The image gallery part was really cool. Basically it was just laying the template-columns and then placing each grid item following the grid-lines. Kid's stuff.

![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16104985/34470598-f740ecac-ef5a-11e7-9dcc-b674633026f8.PNG)

Also learned a rather cool emmet trick to use while writing HTML markup for this type of image gallery

```html
<!-- This and then pressing tab would-
(img.gallery__img--$[src="img/gallery-$"][alt="Gallery Image $"])*5

<!-- print this number of times specified in increasing order, üòé
<img src="img/gallery-1" alt="Gallery Image 1" class="gallery__img--1">
```
**Thing(s) learned :**
- How to make a simple card component using grid and flexbox
- Grid overlapping method + z-index to position items.
- `<sup>` tag to write superscript numbers
- object-fit property for images to maintain aspect ratio

**Link(s) to work :**
- [CSS grid project code](https://github.com/shovanch/advanced-css-course-projects/tree/master/Nexter)
- [Live project site](https://shovanch.com/advanced-css-course-projects/Nexter/)  (work-in-progress)
